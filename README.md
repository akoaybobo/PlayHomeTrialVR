# PlayHomeVR

This is an experimental mod for PlayHome that introduces VR capabilities for both the Vive and the Oculus Rift using OpenVR. It provides both a seated and a standing mode to be usable in any environment.

It is based on work from [Eusth](https://github.com/Eusth/) who wrote the framework and plugins for earlier games (and this manual actually).

## Installation

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/Riqorm/PlayHomeVR/releases) and extract it into your *PlayHome* directory.
2. Drag the game executable onto IPA.exe 
3. Run and Enjoy!

**Caution:** SteamVR needs to be installed, set up, and running! Rift users might otherwise experience a weird "monitor" effect.

## Modes & Controls

HoneySelectVR comes in two *modes*:

| Mode        | Description         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Seated      | *Default mode.* This mode lets you play the game with a mouse, keyboard, or gamepad.<br />The controls are essentially the same as in the main game. The screen is presented on a big monitor in front of you. |
| Standing    | As soon as tracked controllers are registered by the game, it switches into *standing mode*, also called *room scale mode*. In this mode, you can freely move around and use your Vive or Touch controllers to stuff. |


### Seated Mode

As stated earlier, the controls are basically the same as in the main game with the exception of a few VR-related shortcuts. You are presented with a screen in front of your that replaces your monitor


### Standing Mode

The *standing mode* is where things start to get interesting. This mode is pretty much disconnected from the usual game in that it comes with its very own controls

## Tools

These tools are mainly meant to be used in *standing mode* but some of them are also available in *seated mode*. By default, your left hand will start with the *menu tool* and your right hand will start with the *warp tool*. In order to change them on either hand, press the *menu button* on your Vive controller. 

### Menu Tool (seated / standing)

With the *menu tool* you can interact with the user interface of the game. There are, in fact, two ways you can control the mouse: a two-handed way that makes use of a laser pointer, and a one-handed way that lets you use your trackpad like a ... touchpad!

#### Laser pointer

To use the laser pointer, simply point the *other controller* at the menu screen. A laser pointer will appear and you can easily interact with the UI. To make a click, press the trigger button.

#### Trackpad

To use the trackpad, slide with your thumb over the trackpad and the mouse cursor will move accordingly. To make a click, press the trackpad.

#### Attaching, Detaching and Resizing the Menu

It's possible to detach and resize the menu you're holding at any point in the game.

Simply press the grip button to "let go" of the menu screen -- the screen will then stay put where you left it. You can even use other tools and still interact with the screen using the *laser pointer* mechanism.

Furthermore, it's possible to *resize* the screen. In order to do that, point both your controllers at a screen, press the trigger button, and move the controllers apart. It's also possible to move the screen around like this.

Lastly, to take control of the screen again, press the grip button once more.

### Warp Tool (standing)

The *warp tool* is only available in room scale mode and allows you to jump around in the scene.

#### Warping

In order to warp, touch the trackpad, choose your position and press. While touching the trackpad you are able to see:

1. Where you will warp to
2. Your play area
3. A HMD that further shows where your head will be

You can also *rotate* your play area while touching the trackpad by drawing circles with your thumb.

### Obey Tool

The *obey tool* lets you undress the actress in game. It's very self explaining, but a more detailed description will follow.
